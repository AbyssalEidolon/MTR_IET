Each pose can consist of 5 relative positions which include joints for all 5 fingers. Which joints will be used specifically will be determined later.
Each position for a finger is also toggleable on a finger by finger basis.

**Each tool should also contain a start pose and an end pose to calculate tolerable ranges for each finger to register.**
